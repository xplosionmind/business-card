# 🪪 Tommi’s “business” card 🧐

This is my card, created to have something to hand out to interesting people I meet [around the world](https://tommi.space/places 'Around The World – tommi.space').

## 🔥 Fuck capitalism

I am not a fan of “business”, neither as a term nor as a mindset. I hate to have a “business” card, so I am just calling it “card” for the time being.

## 🗃️ Files and branches

All files in this repository are Inkscape SVGs: they can be opened with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org), and possibly exported in other formats, too.

- [`main` branch](https://codeberg.org/tommi/card): current design iteration of the card.
- [`v1` branch](https://codeberg.org/tommi/card/src/branch/v1): first sketch of the business card dating back to [22 November 2020](https://codeberg.org/tommi/card/commit/d8171fd915dbe4446f838fcb4004400e75a27f8d 'Initial commit of this repository'), but never printed.
- [`sticker` branch](https://codeberg.org/tommi/card/src/branch/sticker): a silly idea I had about making the business card an egocentric sticker, never realized.

## 🤖 Software

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org), to design, edit, and export the card files.
- [Libqrencode](https://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/), to generate the [vCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard 'vCard on Wikipedia') QR code.
- I honestly cannot remember the icon pack I took the icons from four years ago, when I sketched the first version. I will give proper acknowledgement as soon as I figured out what I used.
